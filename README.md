# Soda_Machine
This repository hosts the files for "Soda Machine," a debugging exercise to allow debugging practice in VS Code.  The code is intentionally broken and contains syntax errors, spelling errors, and logic errors that are to be resolved via the use of VS Code debugger.  The endstate of this repository is to host the files with changes made to make Soda Machine into fully functional, syntactically and logically correct code.
